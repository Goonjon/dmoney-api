# Dmoney API Automation
### Project Summary: Performed Integration and API testing on dmoney API. In here I have automated the CRUD functionalities for a user.This project simulates a financial transaction system where an Admin creates an Agent, Customers, and a Merchant. It involves depositing and transferring funds between these entities, checking balances, and verifying transaction statements using unique transaction IDs.
